# minimlst

minimlst (pronounced miniMLST or minimalist) is a fast method for extracting alleles of typing loci from DNA seqeunce assemblies. The name reflects three things (1) My minimalist approach to coding (see 3), (2) the use of minimiser-based indexing and (3) The awesome [minimap2][minimap] program by Heng Li which does all of the hard work.
