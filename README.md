# minimlst

minimlst (pronounced miniMLST or minimalist) is a fast method for extracting alleles of typing loci from DNA seqeunce assemblies. The name reflects three things (1) that the method makes use of minimiser-based indexing and seeding, (2) my minimalist approach to coding (see 3) and (3) as a nod to the awesome [minimap2][minimap2] program by Heng Li which does all of the hard work.
